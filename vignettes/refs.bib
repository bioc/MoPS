  abstract = {During the cell cycle, the levels of hundreds of mRNAs change in a
	periodic manner, but how this is achieved by alterations in the rates
	of mRNA synthesis and degradation has not been studied systematically.
	Here, we used metabolic RNA labeling and comparative dynamic transcriptome
	analysis (cDTA) to derive mRNA synthesis and degradation rates every
	5 min during three cell cycle periods of the yeast Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae. A novel statistical model identified 479 genes that show
	periodic changes in mRNA synthesis and generally also periodic changes
	in their mRNA degradation rates. Peaks of mRNA degradation generally
	follow peaks of mRNA synthesis, resulting in sharp and high peaks
	of mRNA levels at defined times during the cell cycle. Whereas the
	timing of mRNA synthesis is set by upstream DNA motifs and their
	associated transcription factors (TFs), the synthesis rate of a periodically
	expressed gene is apparently set by its core promoter.},
